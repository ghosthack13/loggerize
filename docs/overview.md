## Overview

Loggerize is easy to grasp as long as one understands its three core concepts: 
handles, targets and formatters. The handle is the main configuration which 
dictates how logs are to be managed and which target and formatter to use. The 
target dictates the destination that the logs are to be written to, and the 
formatter dictates how the logs should look on the target when it is eventually 
written.
