# End-User License Agreement (EULA)

Last updated: February 5, 2019.

This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between You the 
User ("Licensee") and Loggerize Inc ("Licensor"). This EULA agreement governs 
the acquisition and use of the Loggerize (also known as LoggerizeJS) software 
("Software") directly from the Licensor or indirectly through an authorized 
reseller or distributor (a "Reseller").

Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the installation
process and using the Software. It provides a license to use the Software and 
contains warranty information and liability disclaimers. If you register for a 
free trial of the Software, this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. 
By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the Software, you are confirming 
your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this 
EULA agreement.

If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other 
legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and 
its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority 
or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do 
not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.
This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by the Licensor
herewith regardless of whether other Software is referred to or described herein.
The terms also apply to any Software updates, supplements, Internet-based
services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those
items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.

## 1. LICENSE GRANT.

### 1.1 Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the licensor grants You, 
the User, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license, without 
the right to sublicense, to permit User Employees to use the Software and the 
Documentation solely for internal use as it relates to operations of the User. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Licensor grants the User the right to
sublicense the Software to User's end-users only when User's own Software is 
built to include the Software. This sublicense grant expressly excludes the Users 
from allowing end-users to further sublicense any intellectual property included 
but not limited to the Licensor's platform-specific tools or any other element of 
the Software distribution.

publish, distribute, reproduce, assign, transfer, rent, lease or loan the Licensed
Materials; or (v) use the Licensed Materials for commercial time-sharing or service
bureau use.

### 1.3 Copies of Documentation

User may make a reasonable number of copies of the Documentation solely to support 
User's use of the Software as authorized under this Agreement, provided that such

acquire any rights to the Software, except as expressly set forth above. All copies
of the Software will contain the same proprietary notices as contained in or on the
Software. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including but
not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text and

You and the Licensor acknowledge and agree that in the event of a third party claim that 
the Software or Your possession or use of the Software infringes any third
party's intellectual property rights or if you distribute the Software in violation

investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such claim of intellectual 
property infringement. You will, however, promptly notify the Licensor in 
writing of such a claim. 

## 8. Termination.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such
provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such
provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining

terms and conditions of this License, then this License and any rights afforded 
to You hereunder shall terminate automatically, without any notice or other 
action by the Licensor. Upon the termination of this License, You shall cease 
all use of the Software and uninstall the Software.
